# Object Detection with Hugging Face Transformers

This repository provides an example of performing object detection using the Hugging Face Transformers library. It demonstrates how to leverage pre-trained models for object detection tasks.

## Project Description

This project showcases how to utilize the power of Hugging Face Transformers for object detection. Object detection is a computer vision technique that involves identifying and locating objects within an image or video. This example provides a practical demonstration of how to:

* **Load pre-trained object detection models:** Utilize models available in the Hugging Face Model Hub.
* **Process images:** Prepare images for input to the object detection model.
* **Perform object detection:** Run the model to detect objects in an image.
* **Visualize the results:** Display the image with bounding boxes drawn around detected objects.

This repository serves as a starting point for exploring and implementing object detection using the Hugging Face ecosystem.

## Features

* **Model Loading:** Demonstrates how to load pre-trained object detection models from the Hugging Face Model Hub (e.g., DETR, YOLO-based models).
* **Image Preprocessing:** Includes code for preparing images for input to the model (e.g., resizing, normalization).
* **Object Detection Inference:** Performs object detection on input images using the loaded model.
* **Result Visualization:** Provides functions for visualizing the detection results by drawing bounding boxes and labels on the image.

## Technologies Used

* Python 3.x
* Hugging Face Transformers
* PyTorch
* Pillow (PIL) for image processing
* OpenCV

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone ..
    cd object-detection-hugging-face-example
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment:**

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
    venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
    ```

3.  **Install the required dependencies:**

## Usage

1.  **Prepare an image:** Place the image you want to perform object detection on in the appropriate directory or specify its path in the code.
2.  **Run the object detection notebook:**

3.  **Analyze the results:** The notebook will process the image and typically display the results.
